        P-items are items that take effect during produce, lessons, and exams. The P-items you have at the start differ depending on the chosen produce idol. You can also obtain them during produce after the midterm exam or via support cards.<br>※The effect of the same P-item only activates once per effect activation timing.<br>※Effects triggered by changes in status only activate when conditions are met by using skill cards.
