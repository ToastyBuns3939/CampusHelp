        There are two types of exams during Produce: midterms, which happen partway through, and the final exam, which determines your overall evaluation. Your ranking in the final exam affects the ending. Exams proceed similarly to lessons, but with some unique rules.<br>If you fail to meet the pass condition in a midterm, Produce ends at that point.<br><br>■ About Score<br>When using skill cards during exams, you gain score instead of increasing parameters.<br><br>■ Pass Condition<br>In exams, you compete for score by using skill cards. Rankings are based on total score, and placing 3rd or higher means you pass.<br>※Some exams require reaching a certain score to pass regardless of ranking.<br><br>■ Score Bonus<br>Score bonuses are granted based on your Vocal, Dance, and Visual parameters and Bond Level. Higher parameters and Bond Level result in higher bonuses.<br><br>■ Retries<br>You can retry the same exam under the same conditions, up to 3 times per Produce run.<br>You get 1 free retry per day; additional attempts require a retry ticket.<br><br>■ Pre-Exam Recovery<br>After the final push lesson, your stamina recovers before the exam begins.
