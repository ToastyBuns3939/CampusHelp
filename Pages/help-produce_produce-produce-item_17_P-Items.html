        P-Items are items that take effect during produce, lessons, and exams. The P-Items you start with vary depending on the produce idol you select. You can also obtain them during produce after the midterm exam or through support card effects.<br><br>※The effect of the same P-Item activates only once per effect activation timing.<br>※Effects that depend on status changes activate only when the condition is met by using skill cards.
