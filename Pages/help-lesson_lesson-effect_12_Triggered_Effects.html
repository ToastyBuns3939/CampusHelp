        Status enhancements or reductions caused by skill cards, P items, cheering, and so on will have various effects as long as they remain active on the field.<br><br>※If a new enhancement or reduction that wasn’t present at the start of the turn appears afterward, that status change will not decrease once due to turn progression.<br>※Effects triggered by changes in status only activate if the condition is met through the use of skill cards or P drinks. However, status changes caused by persistent effects like "Power of Wishes" or "Select Hatsuboshi Macchiato" will not trigger these effects.
