        In the Live Tour Event, you can challenge multiple event stages with different stage details.  <br><br>To challenge an event stage, a Live Challenge Ticket is required.  <br><br>In event stages, the Hype Gauge increases based on the score obtained within the set number of turns, and Event Pt is earned based on the obtained score and score rank.  <br><br>You can also challenge event stages using Skip.  <br><br>When challenged with Skip, all actions are performed automatically, and the performances are skipped.
