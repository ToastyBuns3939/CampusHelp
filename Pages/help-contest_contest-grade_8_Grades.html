        Your rank in the rating points ranking at the end of the season will determine your grade at the start of the next season. The rewards you can earn in contests and the number of memories you can organize will vary depending on your grade. If you do not participate in any contests during a season, your rating points earned during that season will be 0. There are also grades for which there are no conditions for demotion.
